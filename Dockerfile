# we should install the node-gyp collection of tools.

# Note that, rather than copying the entire working directory, we are only copying
# the package*.json file(s). This allows us to take advantage of cached Docker layers.
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./

# npm ci works similarly to npm i, but skips the expensive dependency resolution step,
# and instead just installs the exact dependencies specified in your package-lock.json file.
# It’s basically a faster npm i for use in CI environments.
RUN npm ci

# RUN npm run lint
# RUN npm run test
# RUN npm run build

# get rid of any development dependencies as they are no longer needed past this point.
RUN npm prune --production

# Thats it for the build side. Now, the deployable parts
